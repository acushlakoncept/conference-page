# DEF CON Uyo - Nigeria Conference Page

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/9dfe44d9-6bf9-4cd1-84f0-47825b00fcff/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/defconuyo/deploys)

This project is a complete design on the DEF CON Uyo Conference page (Fictional). A design prototype from Cindy Shin [CC Global Summit 2015](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015).

Complete design of the index, about and ticket page designed using Grid, Flexbox, and Position alongside with other CSS concepts.

In this project, SASS was utilized in compiling the style.css file.

The whole idea of modularizing the styles was indeed a great take away in this project. Thanks to SASS.

I used the CSS checkbox trick to implement the mobile menu.

I have also included the manifest.json file for the web, which holds some metadata for the site info and tells the browser more information about the application. You can easily generate on [here](https://tomitm.github.io/appmanifest/)
